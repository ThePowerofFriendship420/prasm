# PRASM as an AI-Native Project

> **What this is.** The working blueprint for how PRASM operates: a tiny human
> team amplified by AI, so that almost everything — money, time, attention —
> reaches the village. This is the vision behind the future phases the

**Status:** Draft v0.1 · June 2026 · Owner: founder
**Voice:** the same honest, dignity-first register as the rest of the project.
If a line here overclaims, that's a bug — fix it.

## How to read this

- It's a **north star, not a spec.** It says what we're trying to be, ranks
  where AI helps most, and sets the rules AI must follow. Build decisions should
  trace back here.
- It is **deliberately conservative.** We don't write down ambitions we can't
  run honestly.
- It **changes.** Bump the version and date at the bottom when it does.

## The thesis

PRASM is one doctor and a small circle of volunteers, supporting Kayan refugees
who are undocumented and off-grid in the hills of Mae Hong Son. A team this
small normally drowns in back-office work — writing updates, chasing grants,
thanking donors, keeping records, remembering what worked. That work is real,
and every hour of it is an hour not spent in the village.

An AI-native project inverts that ratio.

> **The story is human. The engine room is AI.**
> Donors meet the doctor and the families — never a bot. AI is simply how two
> people do the work of ten, out of sight. And **AI proposes; humans dispose** —
> anything public, clinical, or about a real person gets a human's approval
> before it leaves the building.

What we're optimizing is one number: the share of everything we have that
reaches the families — with the transparency to prove it. AI is the cheapest way
to push that number up without losing the human touch that _is_ the work.

## Principles

These govern every AI decision we make. They're values; the hard, checkable
"never" rules live in [Red lines](#red-lines).

1. **Human story, AI engine room.** AI never becomes the face or the fundraising
   hook. The people are.
2. **AI drafts, a human approves.** Especially for anything public, clinical, or
   about an identifiable person.
3. **Dignity and safety first** — ahead of storytelling and ahead of
   fundraising. When unsure, we hold.
4. **Sensitive data is sacred.** Minimize, consent, control access. Beneficiary
   identity and medical data never go into a general-purpose model casually.
   (→ [Data and privacy model](#data-and-privacy-model))
5. **Low-connectivity-first.** Capture offline, process later. Nothing assumes a
   good signal in the village.
6. **Honest by default.** Same no-overclaim voice as the site. AI never invents
   facts, numbers, names, quotes, or impact.
7. **Cost discipline.** No backers yet. The first stage runs on near-zero infra
   and the founder's own tools. Infrastructure scales with funding and need —
   never ahead of them.
8. **Own the data; stay portable.** Plain, exportable formats. The org's memory
   belongs to the org, not to a vendor.
9. **Boring where it counts.** For anything load-bearing, reliability beats
   novelty. If a shared doc and a human beat a pipeline this month, we use the
   doc.

## The opportunity map

Ranked by _(impact to this org)_ × _(feasibility now)_. The **flagship** is what
we build the concept around; the rest are supporting cast that reuse the same
plumbing — above all the Story Bank (§3.6).

Each entry: **what · why here · the loop · what it needs · risks · stage.**

### 3.1 Field-to-Story Engine — ⭐ Flagship

- **What.** Turn raw field input — a voice note, a few photos, three bullet
  points — into publish-ready drafts: a field note for the site, a donor update,
  and a social caption, all in the house voice.
- **Why here.** Your scarcest resource is the hour it takes to write well. This
  is the highest-leverage, lowest-risk, soonest win, and it feeds the donation
  engine everything else depends on. It builds directly on what we already
  have — the [`content/fieldNotes`](../content/fieldNotes) architecture and an
  established voice.
- **The loop.**
  1. **Capture** (offline OK): record a voice note / snap photos / jot bullets;
     tag whether anyone shown has consented to be public.
  2. **Ingest:** transcribe voice → text; carry the consent + safety tags.
  3. **Draft:** AI writes the field note, a short donor update, and a caption —
     grounded in the Story Bank so voice and facts stay consistent and nothing
     is invented.
  4. **Review:** a human edits and approves — dignity, consent, safety, no
     identifying details, no location leak.
  5. **Publish:** field note → site; update → donor list; caption → socials.
  6. **Learn:** approved pieces enrich the Story Bank, so the next drafts are
     better.
- **Needs.** _Stage A:_ a local authoring tool + templates + the Story Bank as
  structured content (the same "content is data" pattern the
  [README](../README.md) describes); drafts reviewed as files / pull requests;
  approved notes flow into the site we already have. No backend. _Stage B:_ a
  small admin screen so the founder isn't in a terminal.
- **Risks.** Never auto-publish. Never fabricate. Consent/safety tags are
  mandatory gates. Location never leaks.
- **Stage.** A → B.

### 3.2 Grants & Fundraising Copilot

- **What.** Find funders, draft applications tailored to each, and reuse a story
  bank so you're not writing every one from scratch.
- **Why here.** Grants are the path past one-by-one individual donors — the
  realistic route to a first paid year. Drafting is exactly what AI accelerates.
- **The loop.** Funder profile in → tailored draft (grounded in the Story Bank,
  honest about our [status](../content/transparency.ts)) → human refines and
  submits → track outcomes → feed wins back to the bank.
- **Needs.** A funder list + the Story Bank (shared with the flagship). Can start
  in Stage A as soon as the bank exists.
- **Risks.** Never invent outcomes or numbers; every claim traceable. Our honest
  status (no charity registration yet) is stated, not hidden.
- **Stage.** A → B.

### 3.3 Donor Stewardship

- **What.** Personalized thank-yous and updates; care for recurring donors.
- **Why here.** Retention is survival for a small org, and it's almost entirely
  drafting and timing — both things AI does well with a human's final touch.
- **The loop.** A gift (or milestone) → a drafted, personal note → human
  approves → send. Recurring donors get rhythm, not spam.
- **Needs.** Donor records — semi-manual in Stage A, a simple CRM in Stage B.
- **Risks.** Tier-1 PII (→ [Data and privacy model](#data-and-privacy-model)). A
  human always owns tone. Never spammy.
- **Stage.** A (manual) → B. ✅ _v0 thank-you drafter built
  ([`scripts/donor-thanks/`](../scripts/donor-thanks)) and v0 supporter-update
  drafter for recurring donors + newsletter
  ([`scripts/supporter-update/`](../scripts/supporter-update))._

### 3.4 Identity & Case Registry — Medical Record → Identity

- **What.** The mission, made structured. Helping stateless people prove who
  they are is, underneath, a records problem: organized case files, family
  links, histories, and drafted documents (timelines, affidavits). AI organizes
  and drafts; people decide.
- **Where it comes from.** PRASM began as a bioinformation project (the 2018
  whitepaper), and that is still the core. The registry grows _out of_ clinical
  care: getting someone with no ID to a hospital creates a medical record, and
  that record — owned by the person, with clear provenance — becomes their
  identity. Not a separate database bolted on. Full statement and safety rules
  in [`origins.md`](origins.md).
- **Why here.** This is literally _"help them prove who they are."_ A clean
  registry compounds — it's leverage for every future medical, legal, or
  advocacy step. It's also the most **visionary** thread, and the README already
  names it as a future phase.
- **Needs.** A secure store with strict access control and encryption (Stage
  B+). This is **Tier-2 sensitive data** and **must not** flow into a
  third-party model without de-identification or a private/local model.
- **Risks.** The highest stakes here. A leak endangers undocumented people.
  Safety and PDPA design are the _precondition_, not an afterthought — which is
  why this is deliberately not first.
- **Stage.** C (after the data model and a backend are solid).

### 3.5 Clinical & Operations Back-Office

- **What.** Offload the founder's admin so the doctor stays a doctor: drug and
  reference lookups, ICD-10 coding, medicine and supply inventory, logistics to
  a remote village, plain-language bookkeeping.
- **Why here.** Keeps the single most valuable person doing the most valuable
  work. (The ICD-10 coding capability is already on hand in our tooling — this
  part isn't hypothetical.)
- **Needs.** Mostly Stage A/B. Inventory and logistics fit a light backend well.
- **Risks.** **AI is reference, never a clinician** — no diagnosis, no treatment
  decisions. Patient data is Tier 2.
- **Stage.** A → B. ✅ _Starter ICD-10 reference built (validated codes) — see
  [`docs/clinical/icd10-field-reference.md`](clinical/icd10-field-reference.md)._

### 3.6 Institutional Memory — the Story Bank

- **What.** The connective tissue, and quietly the most important build. Two
  layers:
  - a **Story Bank** — the cleared stories, key facts and figures, the people
    (with consent status), and the house voice — that _grounds every draft_ the
    other threads produce; and
  - an **internal knowledge base** — contacts, protocols, decisions, what
    worked — so a two-person org stops forgetting.
- **Why here.** Forgetting is expensive at this size, and grounding is what makes
  everything else _true_ rather than hallucinated. The Story Bank is why the
  flagship can draft in your voice without inventing.
- **Needs.** Stage A as structured files in the repo; Stage C as retrieval (RAG)
  once volume justifies it.
- **Risks.** Keep public (Tier 0) and sensitive (Tier 2) strictly separated.
- **Stage.** A → C.

### 3.7 Cross-cutting, later

- **Translation layer** — Thai / Burmese / Kayan / English across comms and
  records. (Distinct from the public-site translation we agreed to leave for
  last.) _Groundwork laid: `npm run translate:extract` emits a translator-ready
  worksheet of all site copy._
- **Donor-facing site assistant** — grounded Q&A about the cause and how to
  help, answering _only_ from approved public content. On-brand, but the easiest
  to get wrong, so: last.

### 3.8 Curiosity Program (education and AI literacy)

- **What.** The first program we run _with_ the village, not only _for_ it:
  children, teens, and adults meet AI in a safe, supervised "kid mode," get
  curious, and use it to learn. Genuine engagement, captured gently, becomes the
  on-ramp to the Identity & Case Registry (§3.4) and a picture of what each
  learner loves, so we can bring real, targeted help (a botany kit for the child
  who keeps asking how plants drink).
- **Why here.** It turns the most visionary, highest-stakes thread (§3.4) into
  something we can start safely and soon, because the literacy work needs almost
  no sensitive data. It builds the trust and consent the registry will later
  depend on, and it is the clearest proof the mission grows people, not just
  records them.
- **The loop.** Guardian consent → a welcome (a printed, framed photo, given as a
  gift) → supervised kid-mode sessions (offline ok) → what sparks the learner,
  surfaced openly and minimally → targeted follow-through from a small "spark
  fund," a human approving each → a learner who keeps coming back → only later,
  and only on a secure backend, a registry record.
- **Needs.** Incentives that reward sustained engagement, never a head count: a
  stipend for the steward rather than a per-profile bounty, recognition and help
  for families rather than cash. A constrained, supervised kid mode. Guardian
  consent that is explicit and revocable. The two-layer data model (celebratory
  Tier 0, private Tier 2). The registry half waits for the Stage B/C backend.
- **Risks.** The sharpest in the project: coercive incentives with families who
  have few options, surveillance of minors if interests are profiled quietly
  instead of openly, and a registry of undocumented children that is catastrophic
  if it leaks (Risk #1). Held by sequencing (literacy now, registry later),
  openness and consent, non-cash family incentives, and Tier 2 least privilege.
  The published Safeguarding promise (no one acting for PRASM "offers money,
  gifts, or help in exchange for anything") stays true by keeping incentives
  organizational, transparent, and non-contingent.
- **Stage.** B → C. The literacy pilot is near-term and lean; the registry is
  Stage C behind a secure backend. Full proposal in
  [`curiosity-program.md`](curiosity-program.md), the rollout pack in
  [`governance/curiosity-program-rollout.md`](governance/curiosity-program-rollout.md),
  and a clickable demo in `/preview`.

## Architecture & stages

Design rule: **each stage is useful on its own and earns the next.** We never
build infrastructure ahead of need. (These stages sit _inside_ the org phases
the [README](../README.md) describes: Stage A runs entirely within today's
no-backend website; Stages B–C are the future phases it teases.)

**Stage A — Authoring. Now, near-zero infra.**
Lives in this repo. The Story Bank and templates are structured content (the
existing [`content/`](../content) pattern). A local tool turns field input into
drafts; drafts are reviewed as files / pull requests; approved field notes flow
into the site we already have. Runs on the founder's own AI subscription — no
servers, nothing to maintain. The point is to prove the loops and the voice
before spending a baht.

**Stage B — Backend. When there's a reason (ideally funding).**
Managed Postgres + auth + storage + serverless functions for: contact and
newsletter capture, a simple donor CRM, grant tracking, and a small admin UI so
the founder isn't living in a terminal. Worth noting: these rails are reachable
from our tooling today, so this is a _when_, not a _whether_.

**Stage C — Compounding.**
The secure Identity & Case Registry (Tier 2, privacy-preserving), retrieval over
the knowledge base, automated impact reporting (activity → "where your gift
went"), and the donor-facing assistant.

The flagship loop — the pattern the rest reuse:

```
   field input ──▶ ingest / transcribe ──▶ AI draft  (grounded in Story Bank)
   (offline ok)        + consent tags          │
                                               ▼
                                    human review & approve ──▶ publish / send
                                               │                     │
                                               └──────── Story Bank ◀─┘  (learns)
```

## Human-in-the-loop, concretely

Approval gates aren't a courtesy; they're the design. Who approves what:

- **Public content** (field notes, social, donor updates): the founder, or a
  trusted delegate, approves every piece.
- **Anything naming or showing a person:** requires a logged consent + safety
  check first.
- **Clinical reference output:** informational only; the doctor decides.
- **Sensitive records:** access limited to named people; every change logged.

The line to hold: **AI removes the typing, never the judgment.**

## Data and privacy model

Everything above stands or falls here. We sort all data into three tiers and
treat each differently. This is also our PDPA backbone — the
[privacy policy](../content/legal/privacy.ts) already makes the promise; this is
how we keep it.

| Tier                | Examples                                                                                                      | Where it lives                        | AI use                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 · Public**      | Published field notes, programs, cleared Story Bank entries                                                   | The repo / public site                | Free to use as grounding                                                    |
| **1 · Operational** | Donor contacts, grant drafts, supply inventory, logistics                                                     | Access-controlled backend (Stage B)   | Use with care; minimize PII in prompts                                      |
| **2 · Sensitive**   | Beneficiary identities, family links, undocumented status, photos of identifiable people, medical information | Encrypted, strict access, local-first | **Never** to a third-party model without de-identification or a private one |

Rules that follow:

- **Collect the minimum.** If we don't need it, we don't store it.
- **Consent is explicit and revocable** — especially for photos and stories
  (ties to the [Safeguarding](../content/legal/safeguarding.ts) and
  [Privacy](../content/legal/privacy.ts) policies already published).
- **Tier 2 is the red line.** It does not leave a controlled environment and is
  never pasted into a general-purpose chatbot. When AI must touch it,
  de-identify first or use a private/local model.
- **Retention and access are logged.** Keep things only as long as useful; be
  able to say who saw what.
- **PDPA-aligned by construction**, not bolted on.

## Red lines

The enforceable subset — what AI must **never** do here, however convenient:

- Never publish or send anything externally without human approval.
- Never invent facts, numbers, names, quotes, or impact. Grounded, or it doesn't
  ship.
- Never reveal the village's location or anything that could identify or
  endanger an undocumented person.
- Never make a clinical decision. Reference only.
- Never feed Tier-2 data to a third-party model without de-identification or a
  private setup.
- Never let "AI" become the public face or the fundraising hook over the people.

## What we are deliberately NOT doing

Discipline is mostly a list of noes:

- No chatbot-as-mascot, no "powered by AI" badges on a vulnerable-people cause.
- No autonomous agents acting unsupervised on the org's behalf.
- No premature backend; no infra we can't afford or maintain.
- No data hoarding "because we might need it."
- No novelty for its own sake.
- No replacing the human relationships that _are_ the work.

## Roadmap — first concrete steps (Stage A)

In order:

1. **Stand up the Story Bank** as a structured content module — voice, key
   facts, cleared stories, people + consent status. The spine everything grounds
   on. ✅ _Done — see [`content/storyBank/`](../content/storyBank)._
2. **Field-to-Story tool (v0):** a local script — voice/notes in, three drafts
   out (field note, donor update, caption) — reusing the Story Bank. ✅ _Done —
   see [`scripts/field-to-story/`](../scripts/field-to-story)._
3. **Bake in the approval checklist:** consent tag, safety/location check, voice
   check. ✅ _Done — deterministic scans in
   [`scripts/lib/checks.ts`](../scripts/lib/checks.ts), shared by both tools._
4. **One real run:** take an actual field visit end to end; publish one field
   note, send one update; learn and refine the voice and templates. _(Needs a
   real voice note + an API key — over to the founder.)_
5. **Grants copilot (v0)** once the Story Bank exists — it reuses it directly.
   ✅ _Done — see [`scripts/grants/`](../scripts/grants)._

Then reassess: has Stage A earned a Stage B backend?

## Decisions I need from you

My lean is listed first where I have one.

- **Flagship.** I've set **Field-to-Story** as the flagship — highest leverage,
  lowest risk, no backend, builds on what we have. The **Identity & Case
  Registry** is the more visionary pick, but it's Tier-2 and Stage C, so it
  can't be first. Say the word if your heart's elsewhere.
- **Entity path** (from our last talk): own Thai foundation vs. fiscal
  sponsorship vs. a US 501(c)(3) sponsor. Gates tax receipts and the
  "registered" language on the site. → Researched and tailored to your donor
  base (Korea + targeting US/UK/EU/Canada) in
  [`docs/governance/entity-options.md`](governance/entity-options.md): **lead
  with a US fiscal sponsor now**, then list with Asia/global intermediaries
  (Give2Asia, GlobalGiving) as a track record builds; a Thai presence (FPO or
  foundation) is a separate track. **One fact still open: is the founder Thai or
  foreign?** — it gates the Thai-entity choice.
- **AI tooling for the engine room:** default to the strongest general model,
  with a private/local option reserved for Tier 2. (Recommendation, not urgent.)
- **When to cross into Stage B** (backend): my advice — not until Stage A has
  proven the loops with one real run.

## Changelog
