/**
 * Copy for the first-run guided tour of the /preview demo. Content as data so it
 * stays easy to edit and, later, to translate. English first.
 *
 * The tour walks one full loop: a village steward welcomes a child, signs out,
 * then signs back in as that child and lands in their learning space. The tour
 * performs the safe screen changes itself and hands control back at the two
 * moments only a person can do (filling the welcome form, and signing in with a
 * picture and a PIN).
 *
 * Voice: warm, plain, honest. Short sentences. No jargon.
