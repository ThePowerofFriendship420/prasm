/**
 * "AI in the engine room": PRASM's public, partner-facing statement of how it

 * partners.
 *
 * Honest by default (the site's rule): the back-office tools described as
 * "running" are really built and in use by the team; the health, education, and
 * identity applications are stated as where we are going, not where we are. The
 * people are always the face; AI is never the story.
